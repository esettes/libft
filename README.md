C functions implementation to use in my projects.

## Norm

Some of the most important points of the norm.

#### Functions:
- Per function no more than:
  - 25 lines.
  - 5 variables.
  - 4 parameters.
- No more than 80 columns per line.
- Only single instruction per line.
- Variable declarations and initializations must be in different lines.

#### Operators, conditionals, ...:
- Forbidden stuff:
  - Conditionals and loops:
    - for
    - do...while
    - switch...case
    - goto
  - Ternary operators like '?'
  - Variable Length Arrays
  - Implicit type in variable declaration.

Any library functions that aren't explicitly allowed to use in specific project, it's forbidden.
